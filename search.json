    "text": "The border battle is basically a personality trait at this point for Wisconsin and Minnesota. If there is one thing mid-westerners love more than cheese curds and football is this rivalry. Wisconsin has cheese curds, tailgating, and beer. What does Minnesota even have?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(hoopR)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(hoopR)\n\nmlb &lt;- read_csv(\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTpoNkooywS_R5VoSyzKXVYiaH8E0L_B6PpdXGL4PMDwlgFyE4HzwXqGZP0jM6s0usLROqJa0JiBoB_/pub?output=csv\")|&gt;\n  group_by(Team) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    avg_winper = mean(win, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(avg_winper))\n\n\nsb &lt;- \"https://www.pro-football-reference.com/super-bowl/\" \n\nsbchamp &lt;- sb |&gt;\n  read_html() |&gt;\n   html_node(xpath = '//*[@id=\"super_bowls\"]') |&gt;\nhtml_table() \n  \nappearances &lt;- sbchamp |&gt;\n     pivot_longer(cols = c(Winner, Loser), values_to = \"team\") |&gt;\n  count(team, name = \"appearances\")\n\nwinsonly &lt;- sbchamp |&gt;\n  select(Winner) |&gt;\n   count(Winner, name = \"wins\") |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(wins))\n\nloseronly &lt;- sbchamp |&gt;\n  select(Loser) |&gt;\n   count(Loser, name = \"loser\") |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(loser))\n\nGB &lt;- winsonly |&gt;\n  filter(Winner == \"Green Bay Packers\")\n\n\noffdef &lt;- read_csv(\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQ2q17BqWtzbtCjTtHVKDXkwN8wkD2iXww5pSWUZVBfgJkB5Oomelb5DeFyq_SzSP6TyTnG9hV41h_S/pub?gid=0&single=true&output=csv\") |&gt;\n  group_by(Team) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    avg_ORtg = mean(ORtg, na.rm = TRUE), avg_DRtg = mean(DRtg, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(avg_ORtg))\n\n\nTwo key metrics, offensive and defensive rating, provide insight into how efficiently teams score points and how well they prevent opponents from scoring. This chart visualizes the average offensive and defensive percentage over recent seasons. The blue points represent offensive ratings, while the red points represent defensive ratings. Each line connects a team’s offensive and defensive ratings, allowing a quick visual comparison of strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data = offdef,\n    aes(\n      y = reorder(Team, avg_DRtg),\n      x = avg_ORtg,\n      xend = avg_DRtg\n    ), size = 2,\n    colour = \"lightgrey\",\n    colour_x = \"blue\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\"\n  ) +\ntheme_minimal() +\n   theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    y = \" \",\n    x = \" \",\n    title=\"Border Battle in the NBA, WI on Top\", \n    subtitle=\"The average offensive and defensive percentages in these teams over the last eight seasons.

The Packers’ bar stands filled in dark green, symbolizing the legacy they’ve built over decades. Meanwhile, the Vikings are absent from this highlighted list of champions. Four appearances, four losses, and decades without a return have left Minnesota watching from the outside as their biggest rival continues to build on a winning tradition.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=winsonly, aes(x=reorder(Winner, wins), weight=wins), fill=\"lightgrey\") +\ngeom_bar(data=GB, aes(x=reorder(Winner, wins), weight=wins), fill=\"darkgreen\")+\n  coord_flip() +\ntheme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Super Bowl Wins\", \n    title=\"Super Bowl Wins, but Where are the Vikings?\", \n    subtitle=\"Super Bowls wins in the NFL for all time.

Minnesota: Still trying.\nDon’t get me wrong, the Vikings have made it to the Super bowl four times, but have choked every single time. Close calls? A few. Championships? None.\nEven after this first two graphs show the real winner of the battle with the lack of Minnesota even pulling off one Super Bowl win, you’re still not convinced? With this last graph, it is the win percentage in the MLB. Take a look at who comes out on top more.\n\n\nCode\nmlb|&gt; \n  arrange(desc(avg_winper)) |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    Team = \"Team Name\",\n    avg_winper = \"Average Win Percent\", \n    ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"WI in Top Five, Again Where is MN?\",\n    subtitle = \"The average win percent in the MLB over the last five years.
