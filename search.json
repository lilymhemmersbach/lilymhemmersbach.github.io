    "section": "",
    "text": "The question on my mind, do the size of crowds have an impact on team’s ability to win? Over the 2020–2025 seasons, we analyzed men’s basketball across the NCAA and more specifically the BIG Ten to explore how home attendance relates to scoring and wins. Using scatterplots of attendance versus home scores, we highlighted wins in red and losses in grey. The data shows a clear pattern. Teams that draw larger crowds often score higher at home and win more games. The shaded regions on the graphs emphasize teams performing above the average, reinforcing the idea that crowd support can boost performance.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(hoopR)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\n\ngamesone &lt;- load_mbb_schedule(seasons = 2025)\n\ngamestwo &lt;- load_mbb_schedule(seasons = 2024)\n\ngamesthree &lt;- load_mbb_schedule(seasons = 2023)\n\ngamesfour &lt;- load_mbb_schedule(seasons = 2022)\n\ngamessix &lt;- load_mbb_schedule(seasons = 2020)\n\ngames &lt;- bind_rows(gamesone, gamestwo, gamesthree, gamesfour, gamessix)\n\nbigtenone &lt;- gamesone |&gt;\nfilter(home_conference_id == \"7\") \n\nbigtentwo &lt;- gamestwo |&gt;\nfilter(home_conference_id == \"7\") \n\nbigtenthree &lt;- gamesthree |&gt;\nfilter(home_conference_id == \"7\")\n\nbigtenfour &lt;- gamesfour |&gt;\nfilter(home_conference_id == \"7\") \n\nbigtensix &lt;- gamessix |&gt;\nfilter(home_conference_id == \"7\") \n\nbigtenwinone &lt;-gamesone |&gt;\nfilter(home_conference_id == \"7\") |&gt;\n  filter(home_winner==TRUE)\n\nbigtenwintwo &lt;- gamestwo |&gt;\nfilter(home_conference_id == \"7\") |&gt;\n  filter(home_winner==TRUE)\n\nbigtenwinthree &lt;- gamesthree |&gt;\nfilter(home_conference_id == \"7\") |&gt;\n  filter(home_winner==TRUE)\n\nbigtenwinfour &lt;- gamesfour |&gt;\nfilter(home_conference_id == \"7\") |&gt;\n  filter(home_winner==TRUE)\n\nbigtenwinsix &lt;- gamessix |&gt;\nfilter(home_conference_id == \"7\") |&gt;\n  filter(home_winner==TRUE)\n\nbigtengame &lt;- bind_rows(bigtenone, bigtentwo, bigtenthree, bigtenfour, bigtensix)\n\nbigtenwingame &lt;- bind_rows(bigtenwinone, bigtenwintwo, bigtenwinthree, bigtenwinfour, bigtenwinsix)\n\nhomewins &lt;- bigtengame |&gt;\n  filter(home_winner==TRUE) |&gt;\n  group_by(home_display_name) |&gt;\n  summarize(home_score = mean(home_score, na.rm = TRUE), avgwinnergone=mean(attendance, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nwinnergone &lt;- gamesone |&gt;\n  filter(home_winner==TRUE)\n\nwinnergtwo &lt;- gamestwo |&gt;\n  filter(home_winner==TRUE)\n\nwinnergthree &lt;- gamesthree |&gt;\n  filter(home_winner==TRUE)\n\nwinnergfour &lt;- gamesfour |&gt;\n  filter(home_winner==TRUE)\n\nwinnergsix &lt;- gamessix |&gt;\n  filter(home_winner==TRUE)\n\nwinnergames&lt;- bind_rows(winnergone, winnergtwo, winnergthree, winnergfour, winnergsix)\n\n\nEvery dot represents a home game, and every red dot is a win.
