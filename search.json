    "text": "The question on my mind, do the size of crowds have an impact on team’s ability to win? Over the 2020–2025 seasons, we analyzed men’s basketball across the NCAA and more specifically the BIG Ten to explore how home attendance relates to scoring and wins. Using scatterplots of attendance versus home scores, we highlighted wins in red and losses in grey. The data shows a clear pattern. Teams that draw larger crowds often score higher at home and win more games. The shaded regions on the graphs emphasize teams performing above the average, reinforcing the idea that crowd support can boost performance.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(hoopR)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\n\ngamesone &lt;- load_mbb_schedule(seasons = 2025)\n\ngamestwo &lt;- load_mbb_schedule(seasons = 2024)\n\ngamesthree &lt;- load_mbb_schedule(seasons = 2023)\n\ngamesfour &lt;- load_mbb_schedule(seasons = 2022)\n\ngamessix &lt;- load_mbb_schedule(seasons = 2020)\n\ngames &lt;- bind_rows(gamesone, gamestwo, gamesthree, gamesfour, gamessix)\n\nbigtenone &lt;- gamesone |&gt;\nfilter(home_conference_id == \"7\") \n\nbigtentwo &lt;- gamestwo |&gt;\nfilter(home_conference_id == \"7\") \n\nbigtenthree &lt;- gamesthree |&gt;\nfilter(home_conference_id == \"7\")\n\nbigtenfour &lt;- gamesfour |&gt;\nfilter(home_conference_id == \"7\") \n\nbigtensix &lt;- gamessix |&gt;\nfilter(home_conference_id == \"7\") \n\nbigtenwinone &lt;-gamesone |&gt;\nfilter(home_conference_id == \"7\") |&gt;\n  filter(home_winner==TRUE)\n\nbigtenwintwo &lt;- gamestwo |&gt;\nfilter(home_conference_id == \"7\") |&gt;\n  filter(home_winner==TRUE)\n\nbigtenwinthree &lt;- gamesthree |&gt;\nfilter(home_conference_id == \"7\") |&gt;\n  filter(home_winner==TRUE)\n\nbigtenwinfour &lt;- gamesfour |&gt;\nfilter(home_conference_id == \"7\") |&gt;\n  filter(home_winner==TRUE)\n\nbigtenwinsix &lt;- gamessix |&gt;\nfilter(home_conference_id == \"7\") |&gt;\n  filter(home_winner==TRUE)\n\nbigtengame &lt;- bind_rows(bigtenone, bigtentwo, bigtenthree, bigtenfour, bigtensix)\n\nbigtenwingame &lt;- bind_rows(bigtenwinone, bigtenwintwo, bigtenwinthree, bigtenwinfour, bigtenwinsix)\n\nhomewins &lt;- bigtengame |&gt;\n  filter(home_winner==TRUE) |&gt;\n  group_by(home_display_name) |&gt;\n  summarize(home_score = mean(home_score, na.rm = TRUE), avgwinnergone=mean(attendance, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nwinnergone &lt;- gamesone |&gt;\n  filter(home_winner==TRUE)\n\nwinnergtwo &lt;- gamestwo |&gt;\n  filter(home_winner==TRUE)\n\nwinnergthree &lt;- gamesthree |&gt;\n  filter(home_winner==TRUE)\n\nwinnergfour &lt;- gamesfour |&gt;\n  filter(home_winner==TRUE)\n\nwinnergsix &lt;- gamessix |&gt;\n  filter(home_winner==TRUE)\n\nwinnergames&lt;- bind_rows(winnergone, winnergtwo, winnergthree, winnergfour, winnergsix)\n\n\nEvery dot represents a home game, and every red dot is a win.

As attendance climbs, so do home scoring averages and the red dots in this chart make it clear that wins stack up in the high attendance zone. Teams playing in front of 10,000+ fans consistently outperform those in quieter arenas. In short, the Big Ten home court advantage is real. The crowd really is influencing the game.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=bigtengame, aes(x=attendance, y=home_score)) +\n  geom_point(data=bigtenwingame, aes(x=attendance, y=home_score), color = \"red\") +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 5), name=\"Wins\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=12500, y=121), label=\"Average\")+\n   annotate(\"rect\", fill = \"blue\", alpha = 0.1, \n        xmin = 9902.70, xmax = Inf,\n        ymin = 80.38565 , ymax = Inf) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Attendance\", \n    y=\"Home Team Score\", \n    title=\"Higher Attendance, Higher Performance in BIG Ten?\", \n    subtitle=\"Analysis of attendance levels relate to home scoring and wins across BIG Ten mens basketball during 2020-2025 seasons.\nRed = Win, Grey = Loss. \", \n    caption=\"Source: Saiem Gilani. hoopR: Retrieved from https://hoopr.sportsdataverse.org | By Lily Hemmmersbach\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n     plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=9), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems clear—fans matter.

Dark blue for the top 5 teams and grey for the rest.\nThe top teams like Iowa and USC, stand out immediately, not just in score but in how consistently they win when playing at home. The middle tier teams are competitive, but often fall just short of the elite. Meanwhile, the bottom teams struggle to consistently hit high scores, showing how hard it is to dominate in the Big Ten.\n\n\nCode\nhomewins|&gt; \n  arrange(desc(home_score)) |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    home_display_name = \"Team Name\",\n    home_score = \"Average Score\", \n    avgwinnergone = \"Average Attendance\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"How does the BIG Ten attendance relate to wins?\",\n    subtitle = \"The average wins in mens basketball across the 2020-2025 season in the BIG Ten.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Lily Hemmersbach  |  **Source:** Saiem Gilani. hoopR: Retrieved from https://hoopr.sportsdataverse.org\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12))) |&gt;\n   opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"blue\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\", weight = \"bold\")\n    ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = rank(-home_score) &lt;= 5\n    )\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does the BIG Ten attendance relate to wins?\n\n\nThe average wins in mens basketball across the 2020-2025 season in the BIG Ten.\n\n\nTeam Name\nAverage Score\nAverage Attendance\n\n\n\n\nIowa Hawkeyes\n89.61842\n10439.618\n\n\nUSC Trojans\n85.50000\n4194.667\n\n\nIllinois Fighting Illini\n82.93902\n13838.159\n\n\nMichigan Wolverines\n81.90476\n10628.111\n\n\nPurdue Boilermakers\n81.85417\n12949.427\n\n\nOhio State Buckeyes\n81.06944\n11610.472\n\n\nPenn State Nittany Lions\n80.70769\n7708.985\n\n\nOregon Ducks\n80.43750\n6365.000\n\n\nWashington Huskies\n80.11111\n5149.667\n\n\nUCLA Bruins\n79.56250\n6946.188\n\n\nNebraska Cornhuskers\n79.39286\n13239.982\n\n\nMichigan State Spartans\n78.81481\n12756.049\n\n\nMaryland Terrapins\n78.71605\n12201.864\n\n\nIndiana Hoosiers\n78.29870\n15512.143\n\n\nWisconsin Badgers\n76.51351\n14194.595\n\n\nMinnesota Golden Gophers\n76.25926\n8270.741\n\n\nNorthwestern Wildcats\n75.93443\n4639.049\n\n\nRutgers Scarlet Knights\n74.68116\n7603.899\n\n\n\nBy: Lily Hemmersbach | Source: Saiem Gilani. hoopR: Retrieved from https://hoopr.sportsdataverse.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross all the graphs, one thing is clear, bigger crowds often mean higher scores and more wins.

In the BIG Ten, the crowd can be the difference between a close game and a decisive home victory."
